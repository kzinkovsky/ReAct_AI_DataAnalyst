### Dataset and Capabilities

The AI Data Analyst agent works with the publicly available **Bitext dataset** ‚Äî Customer Service Tagged Training Dataset for LLM-based Virtual Assistants  
[üîó Dataset on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bitext/Bitext-customer-support-llm-chatbot-training-dataset#bitext---customer-service-tagged-training-dataset-for-llm-based-virtual-assistants)

It analyzes these dataset fields:  
- **instruction**: user requests from the Customer Service domain  
- **category**: high-level semantic category for intent  
- **intent**: specific intent behind the instruction  
- **response**: example expected assistant response  

Typical questions you can ask:  
- What categories exist?  
- What are the most frequent categories?  
- Show 3 examples of responses for Category CANCEL  
- What is Intent distribution?  
- Summarize how the agent responds to Intent CANCEL  

A session lasts for up to 10 interaction steps or until restarted.
